Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - Better than the original, but some things could still be easier.
    - I have to dig to find 2 of the election dates in 2020.
    - I have to dig to find deadlines for registration and absentee voting in 2020.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the 2020 early voting dates.

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The home page isn't called index.html, which is the traditional name.
    - Headings should probably go inside their articles (in absentee.html for example).

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The green and blue is kind of a surprising color combination.
    - The Voter Registration page has a larger heading than any of its neighbors.
    - The Contact Us page has a different structure and sizing than its neighbors.
